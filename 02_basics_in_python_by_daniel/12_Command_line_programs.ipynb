    "If our programs can take complex parameters or multiple filenames, we shouldn’t handle `sys.argv` directly.

This is yet another rule of programming: *test the simple things first.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our program to process each file separately, so we need a loop that executes once for each filename. If we specify the files on the command line, the filenames will be in `sys.argv`, but we need to be careful: `sys.argv[0]` will always be the name of our script, rather than the name of a file. We also need to handle an unknown number of filenames, since our program could be run for any number of files.\n",

The ‘1’ tells Python to start the slice at location 1, so the program’s name isn’t included; since we’ve left off the upper bound, the slice runs to the end of the list, and includes all the filenames.
